# Tetris Multiplayer Game

Tetris Multiplayer is a fullstack web application that allows users to play the classic game of Tetris either solo or against friends in real-time multiplayer mode

# Tech Stack

**Frontend** - React + TS + vite app. React Router was used for navigation <br />
**Backend** - Express + TS and Websockets using `ws` library for real-time communication in multiplayer mode

# Getting Started

- Clone the repository `https://github.com/NatsuDrag9/tetris-multiplayer.git`
- Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend dir `cd frontend`
- Open another terminal and navigate to the backend dir `cd backend`
- Start the server by executing `yarn run dev` in both terminals

_Currently, Tetris Multiplayer is only playable locally on your PC. However, it will soon be deployed on `Vercel` for easy access. Stay tuned for updates on our deployment progress!_
